# Interruption Recovery Corpora

This repository contains the corpora used a paper under review.

## SLUICE (SPARQL for Learning and Understanding Interrupted Customer Enquiries)

SLUICE contains 21,000 artificially interrupted questions with their underspecified SPARQL queries, and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/AddleseeHQ/SLUICE).

## Disrupted AMR 3.0

Similar to SLUICE, this corpus contains disrupted sentences paired with their underspecified AMR graphs. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/amazon-science/disrupt-amr).

## Clarifications

A subset of the SLUICE corpus with clarification requests can be found in this repo called `clarificationCorpus.json`.

## Clarification Processing

The original SLUICE corpus, and the `clarificationCorpus` were combined and used to generate responses from various LLMs. This corpus can be found in this repo called `recoveryCorpus.json`.
