Sometimes you don't hear everything someone says (for example, if a door slams shut).
You will see an interrupted question, and it would be helpful if you could type what you would naturally respond. Don't overthink it, just write whatever immediately comes to mind.

Examples:
Person: Who was the father of {DOOR SLAM}
Possible response: Sorry, of who?
Possible response: Father of who?
Possible response: I didn't catch all of that, who?

Person: What is the population of {DOOR SLAM}
Possible response: Population of?
Possible response: Sorry, where?
Possible response: Of where?

Person: Who wrote {DOOR SLAM}
Possible response: I didn't hear all of that, what?
Possible response: Who wrote what?
Possible response: Sorry, wrote what?

Task:
Person: INTERRUPTED QUESTION {DOOR SLAM}
Possible response:
