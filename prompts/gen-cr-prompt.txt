Sometimes you don't hear everything someone says (for example, if a door slams shut).
You will see an interrupted question, and it would be helpful if you could type what you would naturally respond. Don't overthink it, just write whatever immediately comes to mind.

Example 1:
Person: Who was the father of {DOOR SLAM}
Possible response: Sorry, of who?
Reason: You apologise for not hearing everything, and then ask "of who?" as the answer must be the father of a human.
Possible response: Father of who?
Reason: You repeat "father of" to indicate where you finished correctly hearing the person. You then ask "who?" because the answer must be the father of a human.
Possible response: I didn't catch all of that, who?
Reason: You let the person know that you didn't hear their whole question, and then ask "who?" because the answer must be the father of a human.

Example 2:
Person: What is the population of {DOOR SLAM}
Possible response: Population of?
Reason: You repeat the last words you heard as a question, indicating where you misheard the person.
Possible response: Sorry, where?
Reason: You politely apologise, and then ask "where?" because you know that locations have populations.
Possible response: Of where?
Reason: You repeat the "of" to indicate where a repair is needed, and then ask "where?" because the answer must be the population of a place.

Example 3:
Person: Who wrote {DOOR SLAM}
Possible response: I didn't hear all of that, what?
Reason: You tell te person that you misheard some of their question. You then ask "what?" to ask what the answer wrote.
Possible response: Who wrote what?
Reason: You repeat the words you did hear in their question. You then ask "what?" because the answer must have written something.
Possible response: Sorry, wrote what?
Reason: You politely apologise, and then say "wrote what?" to indicate which word you misheard, and ask what it was.
